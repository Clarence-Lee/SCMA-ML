# SCMA-ML
Most complexity detector method based on Maximum Likelihood of Sparse Code Multiple Access(SCMA)
# Spare Code Multiple Access(SCMA),稀疏码分多址多址
SCMA is a promissing nonorthogonal multiple access technique, which accommodates the demand of massive connectivity in 5G. Fundamentally, SCMA generalizes the idea of sparely spread CDMA, with a few numbers of nonzero elements within a large singature length.
# Maximum Likehood method
